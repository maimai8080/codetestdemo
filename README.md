### \#Problem Description

```
Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9], the task is to print all possible letter 

combinations that the numbers could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like 

on the telephone buttons) is being followed. Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any 

letters. All the mapping are shown in the image below:
```

#### \#Stage 1 Write a program to convert the digits from 0 to 9 into letters

##### Example:

```java
Input: arr[] = {2, 3}

Output: ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf

Input: arr[] = {9}

Output: w x y z
```

#### \#Stage 2 - new requirements The program need to support converting the digits from 0 to 99 into letters
